      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the greatest economic problems of our time is associated with\r\n",
      "the double stream which has been setting westward across the Atlantic\r\n",
      "with steady persistence for some two or three years, and which even\r\n",
      "now does not seem to have passed its height. It is a stream which\r\n",
      "is composed of the labour and the capital of the Old World. To the\r\n",
      "number of many hundreds of thousands of individuals, some of the best\r\n",
      "bone and sinew of the European states has been transplanted each\r\n",
      "year to America. And latterly, this exodus has been accompanied by a\r\n",
      "large volume of that without which labour can do little collectively.\r\n",
      "During the last twelve months especially, the number of schemes for\r\n",
      "the employment of British capital across the Atlantic has increased\r\n",
      "enormously; and at the present time, there are many millions of money,\r\n",
      "belonging to people still residing on this side, invested directly or\r\n",
      "indirectly in land, and in industries connected with land in the States\r\n",
      "of the Union and of Canada. The receptivity of the American continent\r\n",
      "in respect both of labour and of capital is very great; but it is not\r\n",
      "unlimited. Nor is the supply of either labour or capital unlimited\r\n",
      "in the countries of the eastern hemisphere. There is not as yet any\r\n",
      "imminent danger of excessive contribution in the one case and of\r\n",
      "depletion in the other; but we are within sight of consequences which\r\n",
      "it may be well to consider.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And first with regard to Emigration. It must not be supposed that\r\n",
      "Americaâand for the present let us confine our attention to the\r\n",
      "United Statesâwelcomes without exception the human stream. There are\r\n",
      "undoubtedly elements in it which would be objectionable anywhere. There\r\n",
      "are hordes of paupers and loafers and neâerdoweels, who are as little\r\n",
      "likely to do any good for themselves, or to benefit the community, in\r\n",
      "the New World as in the Old. But apart from these, there has been a\r\n",
      "flow of shrewd workers and skilled artisans, which a certain section\r\n",
      "of the American nation is disposed to regard with a sour look. The\r\n",
      "reason is not far to seek. The dominant economic policy of America has\r\n",
      "been, as we know, one of strict protection of their own industries.\r\n",
      "For the benefit of the few, the many are heavily burdened, in the\r\n",
      "beliefâfallacious, and not always genuinely entertainedâthat in process\r\n",
      "of time the many will reap the harvest. The conductors of these\r\n",
      "domestic industries are glad enough to get all the experienced foreign\r\n",
      "labour they can; but the domestic labourer says, very naturally, that\r\n",
      "the importation is unjust to him. He says, in effect: âYou tax foreign\r\n",
      "products to shut out competition with yourselves; but you admit freely\r\n",
      "foreign producers to compete with me. You raise the cost of living to\r\n",
      "me by the imposition of taxes to foster your trades; yet you reduce\r\n",
      "my means of living by suffering immigration which tends to reduce\r\n",
      "the level of wages.â Here is friction, and friction which is already\r\n",
      "producing sparks. It is not difficult to foresee the result. The\r\n",
      "working-classes cannot continue to burn the candle at both ends for\r\n",
      "ever. It is not practicable for any country in these days to prohibit,\r\n",
      "or even to restrict, the importation of human beings. Nor can America\r\n",
      "say: âWe will receive any number of farm-labourers, or miners, or\r\n",
      "anybody disposed to squat in the backwoods and open up our country; but\r\n",
      "we will draw the line at mechanics or any form of skilled labour which\r\n",
      "we can ourselves produce to the extent of our requirements.â The effect\r\n",
      "of the supply of foreign labour would have been more apparent ere\r\n",
      "this but for the suicidal policy of the American trades-unions, which\r\n",
      "practically prohibit the evolution of domestic skill, by forbidding\r\n",
      "apprenticeship to crafts. But, nevertheless, the effect must eventually\r\n",
      "be to diminish âthe reward of labour.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A well-known American writer holds that the increase in the number\r\n",
      "of labourers does not _tend_ to diminish wages, but the converse.\r\n",
      "What in his opinion causes the tendency of âthe reward of labourâ\r\n",
      "to a minimum in spite of increase in producing-power, is that rent\r\n",
      "increases in a still greater ratio. The result is much the same, as\r\n",
      "far as the labourer is concerned, and it proceeds, whether directly,\r\n",
      "as is commonly held, or indirectly, as the American writer holds, from\r\n",
      "there being three men to house and feed where there had been only two.\r\n",
      "If, however, it be really the matter of rent or interest which affects\r\n",
      "the price of labour, then the American citizen has all the more reason\r\n",
      "to regard with attention the other portion of the stream, namely, the\r\n",
      "flow of British capital for investment in land and cattle in the West.\r\n",
      "We do not know the aggregate capital of the numerous Ranche and other\r\n",
      "Companies which have been lately formed, but it is enormous; and with\r\n",
      "private investments as well, the total British capital occupied in\r\n",
      "them cannot be short of twenty millions sterling, and probably is even\r\n",
      "considerably more. The actual amount is not material to our argument.\r\n",
      "The effect of this tremendous diversion of capital is twofold. It\r\n",
      "is increasing the value of older estates by the absorption of cheap\r\n",
      "competitive lots, and it is arousing in the Americans themselves a\r\n",
      "species of earth-hunger which promises to be very keen. There are\r\n",
      "thoughtful, observing men on the other side of the Atlantic, who,\r\n",
      "noting the disfavour into which investments in railroads have fallen,\r\n",
      "because of their comparatively poor returnsâand also because of the\r\n",
      "distrust begotten by their scandalous managementâand who noting, also,\r\n",
      "the rapidity with which English capital is leading the wayâpredict\r\n",
      "that America is on the eve of the most tremendous land âboomâ ever\r\n",
      "known. That means, in plain English, that the enhancement in the\r\n",
      "value of land, legitimately produced by settlement and cultivationâin\r\n",
      "other words, by the employment of actual capital and labourâwill have\r\n",
      "an artificial enhancement of indefinite extent added to it _by the\r\n",
      "action of speculation_. In all commodities dealt in by man, there is\r\n",
      "an intrinsic value and a speculative value. When the speculative value\r\n",
      "becomes inflated above the level of intrinsic value, there ensues a\r\n",
      "period of dangerous excitement, which invariably ends in collapse and\r\n",
      "disaster. This is especially the case with land, and it is precisely\r\n",
      "towards such a critical time that America seems verging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this, however, seems to us to point to the probability of\r\n",
      "free-trade becoming ere long the watchword of the working-classes\r\n",
      "in the United States. With free-trade in labour concurrently with\r\n",
      "land-speculation, subjecting them to diminution of wages, and at the\r\n",
      "same time increase in the cost of living, they will have no alternative\r\n",
      "but to demand the free admission of all materials bearing on their\r\n",
      "industries and affecting the cost of living. It is possible that in\r\n",
      "the present great land-movement may be germinating the seeds of the\r\n",
      "next great commercial crisis; and upon the theory of periodicity, one\r\n",
      "of these crises will be due in a year or two. So, also, it is probable\r\n",
      "that the Emigration movement from the east has carried and is carrying\r\n",
      "with it elements which will aid in bringing about the much to be\r\n",
      "desired future of free-trade.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Coutts having seen that his father and sisters were provided with all\r\n",
      "necessary comforts, hastened to the city. He had an appointment which\r\n",
      "could not be postponed; he could do nothing more at Ringsford; in town\r\n",
      "he could arrange with some contractor to send out a band of men to make\r\n",
      "the least injured portion of the Manor again habitable, and to clear\r\n",
      "away the dÃ©bris as quickly as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The appointment was to meet Philip and Wrentham at Mr Shieldâs\r\n",
      "apartments. Coutts was confident that the bill he held was a forgery.\r\n",
      "He had no doubt Philip had been fooled into it somehow, but that was no\r\n",
      "reason why _he_ should be fooled out of it. The way Shield had received\r\n",
      "him plainly indicated that he would give him no place in his will;\r\n",
      "whilst he was anxious to avoid scandal which would involve Philip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, if the old fellow wonât give me a slice of his fortune, Iâll\r\n",
      "screw a plum out of it,â was Couttsâs agreeable reflection. âI have the\r\n",
      "forged bill, and unless he hands me over double the amount, I donât\r\n",
      "give it up.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was a âsmartâ stroke of business, which delighted Coutts almost\r\n",
      "as much as the prospect of gaining such a large sum of money, and of\r\n",
      "making the âold fellowâ stump up in spite of himself. There was, too,\r\n",
      "in his mind a kind of moral fitness in the transaction; for it would be\r\n",
      "paying out this precious uncle for some of the annoyance he had caused\r\n",
      "his father. In addition, there was to be reckoned the satisfaction of\r\n",
      "outwitting one of the cutest scamps he had come acrossâa fellow who\r\n",
      "had overreached even himâfor with the same move which was to checkmate\r\n",
      "Shield, Wrentham would be paid out too. He gave little consideration to\r\n",
      "his brother, having no doubt that he would escape all right somehow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had secured the services of a detective who possessed the highest\r\n",
      "qualifications for his office, namely, he was not like a detective\r\n",
      "at all in manner, appearance or speech. Meeting Sergeant Dier in an\r\n",
      "ordinary way, you would regard him as a successful commercial man.\r\n",
      "There was not the slightest flavour of Scotland Yard about him. He\r\n",
      "was a good actor, a good singer, and a capital story-teller. Some of\r\n",
      "his most important discoveries were made whilst he was entertaining a\r\n",
      "roomful of company with his merry anecdotes. The secret of his success\r\n",
      "lay partly in a natural gift for his business, his enthusiasm, and the\r\n",
      "good-nature which underlay it all. He never allowed a scoundrel to\r\n",
      "escape; but he dealt very gently with any poor creature who might be\r\n",
      "betrayed into a first crime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Coutts reached his office, Sergeant Dier was waiting for him.\r\n",
      "Any one looking at the detective as he stood, bareheaded, reading a\r\n",
      "newspaper, would have imagined that he was one of the bank officials.\r\n",
      "He accompanied Coutts to his private room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, what news have you?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOur man has everything prepared for a holiday abroad,â was Dierâs\r\n",
      "smiling reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCan he get away?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âO dear, no; he is at present under the eye of one of my friends, and\r\n",
      "he has been obliged to delay his departure until to-morrow, owing to a\r\n",
      "difficulty he has found in collecting his funds on such short notice.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs that all?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere is a little more,â said Dier complacently. âI have found a man\r\n",
      "who can identify his writing under any disguise.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho is he?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOur manâs brother. It was not easy to persuade him to help us, but he\r\n",
      "consented at the last moment, and is to meet us at Mr Shieldâs place.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCapital,â said Coutts. âYou understand, I do not wish to proceed to\r\n",
      "extremities unless we are forced to it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo you informed me; but the case is turning out such a pretty one that\r\n",
      "it would have been an honour to explain it in court.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNever mind the honour; weâll balance that somehow. I shall be ready in\r\n",
      "twenty minutes, and will meet you at the hotel.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sergeant Dier bowed and left. Outside the room he nodded and smiled\r\n",
      "to himself as he placed a glossy hat jauntily on his head. Mentally\r\n",
      "and cheerfully he was saying: âI donât care about that chapânot much.\r\n",
      "I should not be surprised to find him coming my way sometime with the\r\n",
      "positions changed.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Coutts examined letters, signed papers brought to him by his chief\r\n",
      "clerk, and punctually at the expiration of twenty minutes was on his\r\n",
      "way to Mr Shieldâs hotel. At the door he found Sergeant Dier and Bob\r\n",
      "Tuppit waiting. The poor little conjurer was nervous, and evidently\r\n",
      "required all the robust encouragement of the good-natured detective to\r\n",
      "sustain him in going through with the task he had been persuaded to\r\n",
      "undertake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were immediately conducted to Mr Shieldâs sitting-room. Coutts was\r\n",
      "a little surprised and not pleased to find that Philip and Wrentham\r\n",
      "had arrived before him; and beside Mr Shield stood Mr Beechamâfor whom\r\n",
      "he entertained an instinctive dislike, not to mention that on the few\r\n",
      "occasions of their meeting his wittiest cynicisms had been silenced by\r\n",
      "the quiet searching gaze of the elder man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Philip had not yet heard of the previous nightâs events at Ringsford.\r\n",
      "He was pale, but calm, and he greeted his brother somewhat coldly.\r\n",
      "Wrentham was apparently at ease and playing his part of devoted and\r\n",
      "therefore anxious friend to perfection. He had not yet caught sight\r\n",
      "of Bob Tuppit, who easily hid himself behind the broad shoulders of\r\n",
      "Sergeant Dier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI expected,â said Coutts after formal salutations, âto have had the\r\n",
      "pleasure of a few minutesâ private conversation with you, Mr Shield,\r\n",
      "before we proceeded with this disagreeable business.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI donât think it necessary,â answered Shield in his brusque way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs you will, sir,â continued Coutts with a slight inclination of the\r\n",
      "head. âI have brought with me two persons who will, I believe, aid us\r\n",
      "materially in the inquiry we are about to make.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho are they?â was the blunt query, indicating Mr Shieldâs usual\r\n",
      "impatience of palaver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis is Mr Dier, who is interested on my behalf; and thisâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs a friend of mine,â interposed Dier blandly, âwho is an expert in\r\n",
      "distinguishing handwriting.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wrentham was the only one who showed surprise at these introductions,\r\n",
      "and he moved a little backward at sight of Bob Tuppit, covering his\r\n",
      "uneasiness by a slight cough, as if clearing his throat. Shield looked\r\n",
      "at Beecham, and the latter spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA very good idea, Mr Hadleigh, and as I have some acquaintance with\r\n",
      "Mr Tuppit, I can vouch for his ability to discharge any task he\r\n",
      "undertakes. I presume you have shown him specimens of the different\r\n",
      "handwritings?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI do not understand your position in this affair, Mr Beecham,â said\r\n",
      "Coutts superciliously; âI can only address myself to Mr Shield, or if\r\n",
      "he chooses, I can retire, and let the matter take the ordinary legal\r\n",
      "course.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am here as the friend of Mr Shield,â was the reply, without the\r\n",
      "least symptom of irritation at the manner and words of Coutts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou can speak to him as you would to me,â growled Shield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, very well,â said Coutts, shrugging his shoulders. âI thought you\r\n",

      "must use a magnifying glass.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He whipped one out from the tail-pocket of his coat. Then with its aid\r\n",
      "he carefully compared the writings. After ten minutes he rose, and\r\n",

      "âIt is,â replied Philip, quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Coutts gave a slight shake of the head, as if this was no more than he\r\n",

      "ILLICIT DISTILLATION IN IRELAND.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mountainous districts in the north of Ireland have long been\r\n",
      "famous for the manufacture of whiskyâor as it is sometimes called when\r\n",
      "made without the concurrence of the revenue, âpoteen.â Until the last\r\n",
      "few years, the practice was exceedingly common, even within a few\r\n",
      "miles of towns of considerable size; but latterly the total output of\r\n",
      "spirits has been much reduced in quantity, and has been of inferior\r\n",
      "quality. Various causes have contributed to this. Formerly, the excise\r\n",
      "supervision was not so efficient as it has since become. Very often,\r\n",
      "Englishmen or Scotchmen were selected for Irish districts, and found\r\n",
      "the peasantry combined to a man against them. They were aided, too, by\r\n",
      "a body of police whose sole duties were the detection and exposure of\r\n",
      "frauds against the revenue, and therefore it was a clear issue between\r\n",
      "two parties, with a large body of spectators standing neutral, or\r\n",
      "rather, in the national spirit, strongly sympathising with those who\r\n",
      "were trying to evade the law. Besides, if the Squireâwho was of course\r\n",
      "a magistrateâfound an anonymous present of a five-gallon jar of poteen,\r\n",
      "why should he go and waste good liquor by giving it up, and perhaps by\r\n",
      "so doing get some of his own tenants into trouble! It was clearly none\r\n",
      "of his business; in which opinion his neighbours heartily shared, as\r\n",
      "they sipped it in punch at his festive board. The priest, too, was of\r\n",
      "the same mind; for as long as the âboysâ did not take too much, or beat\r\n",
      "their wives, or neglect attending mass, it was a very convenient way of\r\n",
      "turning an honest penny in those hard times. With the tacit concurrence\r\n",
      "of these two great social forces, the owner of the still had little to\r\n",
      "fear, and could carry on his lawless trade with comparative impunity.\r\n",
      "The possession of a common secret encouraged cordial relations between\r\n",
      "all classes and creeds, until they resembled the proverbial happy\r\n",
      "family. But the events of the last thirty years have changed all this,\r\n",
      "and have indirectly led to a large diminution of private distillation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first blow which it received was the disbanding of the revenue\r\n",
      "police about the year 1858, and the absorption of their duties, and the\r\n",
      "drafting of the most capable members of the force into the Royal Irish\r\n",
      "Constabulary. This body have a great many duties to perform: they keep\r\n",
      "the peace; act as public prosecutors in petty cases; distribute and\r\n",
      "collect the census papers and votes for poor-law guardians; make up\r\n",
      "the agricultural statistics; act as an armed drilled force in time of\r\n",
      "riot; and lastly, as detectives of crime and, since 1858, of illicit\r\n",
      "distillation. On account of these numerous functions, they are brought\r\n",
      "into contact with almost every individual in their district, not so\r\n",
      "much at the barracks as at their own homes; and the sight of an empty\r\n",
      "jar in an unlikely place, or an unusual abundance of spirits about a\r\n",
      "particular house, are signs not lost on the vigilant constable, and\r\n",
      "carefully stored up by him for future use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again, the improved means of transit in the mountainous districts\r\n",
      "have given the affairs of the inhabitants more publicity. Post-vans,\r\n",
      "mail-cars, and narrow-gauge railways, are everywhere furnishing certain\r\n",
      "and regular communication between the better populated and more\r\n",
      "civilised valleys and the poorer and less inhabited mountains. By these\r\n",
      "means, enterprising travellers have penetrated the backward districts,\r\n",
      "and been received with the customary hospitality of the Irish to\r\n",
      "strangers. They are occasionally even permitted to taste the native\r\n",
      "âmountain dew,â and sometimes thoughtlessly bring their entertainers\r\n",
      "into trouble by incautiously boasting of their privileges before\r\n",
      "strangers. The information has been carried to the police force in the\r\n",
      "district in which the, alas! too confiding host resided, and has caused\r\n",
      "a watch to be set on him, resulting eventually in the discovery of the\r\n",
      "fountain-head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But information of this kind is accidental, and therefore such cases\r\n",
      "are rare. The fact is that the chief sources of knowledge are, as\r\n",
      "might be expected from the analogy of other Irish conspiracies, from\r\n",
      "within the camp, which is sure to hold sooner or later some informer.\r\n",
      "A difference of opinion about the division of the spoil, a row amongst\r\n",
      "their womankind, or some such characteristic quarrel, leads to\r\n",
      "ill-feeling, and some impulsive member of the gang, in the haste of\r\n",
      "momentary spite, secretly informs the police. Then the customary and\r\n",
      "well-known scene follows. A force of constabulary fully armed steals\r\n",
      "out under cover of night, carefully surround the fated still-house, and\r\n",
      "advancing from all sides, simultaneously burst in upon the unfortunate\r\n",
      "distillers just as the outlying scout has brought word that the police\r\n",
      "are coming. Resistance, though sometimes attempted, is useless, and the\r\n",
      "dread guardians of the law proceed to destroy the prepared materials,\r\n",
      "seize the still, and quench the fire. Finally, the sad procession of\r\n",
      "police, prisoners, and utensilsâthe last being placed in a cart with\r\n",
      "the manufactured spiritsâwends its way down the mountain-side to the\r\n",
      "nearest barracks. Then, at the next petty sessions of the district, all\r\n",
      "those who were found engaged, together with the tenant on whose holding\r\n",
      "the distillation was being carried on, are heavily fined, with the\r\n",
      "option of a severe term of imprisonment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what has conduced more than anything else to the diminution of\r\n",
      "illicit distillation has been successive bad harvests, rack-renting,\r\n",
      "and absentee landlords. These have produced agrarian outrages, and\r\n",
      "these in their turn have led to Coercion Acts, giving the constabulary\r\n",
      "night-patrol powers of a very comprehensive character. As the\r\n",
      "mountainous districts are the poorest, so the outrages have been\r\n",
      "more frequent there, and the police in seeking for those intent on\r\n",
      "committing crime, have often accidentally found those merely intent on\r\n",
      "distilling poteen. All these discoveries are treasured up, and care\r\n",
      "taken that the same practice will not again occur in the same place;\r\n",
      "and thus the opportunities for illicit distillation are gradually\r\n",
      "becoming fewer and fewer, and everything seems to point towards its\r\n",
      "total extinction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place selected for the operations of the distiller is usually\r\n",
      "some natural hollow, or a sheltered spot partially hidden by some\r\n",
      "overhanging rock. But occasionally there are much more habitable places\r\n",
      "prepared. A favourite example of this is an artificial cave dug out\r\n",
      "in the side of a high bank close to a stream, the proximity of which\r\n",
      "is always necessary for their operations. The entrance is generally\r\n",
      "concealed with great ingenuity by a luxuriant growth of furze and\r\n",
      "other shrubs. Inside, a raised seat of earth, on which some heather\r\n",
      "has been strewn, and a rudely built chimney, complete the structure.\r\n",
      "The functions of the chimney are not by any means exhausted by being\r\n",
      "brought up to the natural level of the earth. As is well known, burning\r\n",
      "peat has an easily recognisable odour, and if this drew attention to\r\n",
      "a wreath of smoke ascending in the midst of a field, the chances of a\r\n",
      "long life for the still-house would be very small. Instead, therefore,\r\n",
      "of being directly brought out, every conceivable artifice is employed\r\n",
      "to render the smoke invisible. Sometimes it is led into a drain; at\r\n",
      "others, into a thick growth of underwood; again, it is carried for\r\n",
      "some distance, and allowed to make its escape in such small quantities\r\n",
      "as to be practically imperceptible. In one case of which we knew, the\r\n",
      "still-house was underground in the vicinity of the ownerâs cottage, and\r\n",
      "advantage of this was taken to convey the chimney up the earthen fence\r\n",
      "and effect a junction with the flue of the kitchen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In some cases, a dwelling-house is chosen in such a locality as to\r\n",
      "defy suspicion. An example of this occurred in a market-town where\r\n",
      "distillation was carried on for many years in the main street within\r\n",
      "a hundred yards of an important constabulary barracks, and the owner\r\n",
      "in this case was said to have amassed a considerable amount of money.\r\n",
      "For aught that is known, many similar instances may still exist, as\r\n",
      "the shrewdness shown by the choice of such a hiding-place renders\r\n",
      "detection, except through treachery, a most unlikely event. It would be\r\n",
      "well perhaps to add, that in the case just related the proprietor of\r\n",
      "the still was a bachelor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having prepared a suitable place, the next thing is to procure a still\r\n",
      "and worm, which are usually manufactured by the local tinker. The still\r\n",
      "is generally made of strong tinned plate, and is of a cylindrical form,\r\n",
      "except the head, which is rounded and enlarged, in order to better\r\n",
      "collect the alcohol as it evaporates. The highest part of the head\r\n",
      "terminates in a tube, wide at first, but gradually becoming narrower,\r\n",
      "until it reaches the worm, which is a long tube curled into a spiral,\r\n",
      "and during work is always kept cold by immersion in water. It is\r\n",
      "sometimes made from tinned plate, but preferably of sheet-copper, as\r\n",
      "this material, in some mysterious way, is said to make better poteen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The still having been procured, the materials from which the spirit\r\n",
      "is extracted must be obtained. Malt is, of course, the most important\r\n",
      "item, but in past times was very difficult to procure, as part of the\r\n",
      "excise officerâs labours, until the repeal of the malt tax, was to\r\n",
      "prevent its preparation in corn-mills, so that the still-owner had\r\n",
      "frequently to choose between making it for himself with imperfect\r\n",
      "appliances, or using an inferior substitute. This was either ordinary\r\n",
      "grain or treacle, generally the latter, from its portability, and the\r\n",
      "quickness with which it could be prepared. Indeed, the extra sale of\r\n",
      "treacle in particular districts has been a very trustworthy indication\r\n",
      "of the quantity of spirits being manufactured. In one village where\r\n",
      "some years ago the average sale was three casks a week, the present\r\n",
      "consumption is not more than one every two months. But perhaps this\r\n",
      "may result as much from the repeal of the malt tax as the decline in\r\n",
      "illicit distillation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The malt or treacle is laid down in water somewhat under boiling-point,\r\n",
      "and allowed to remain there until it has attained to the consistence of\r\n",
      "thin water-gruel. It is now ready for fermentation, which is effected\r\n",
      "by means of yeast; and when this process is complete, the mixture is\r\n",
      "called âwash,â and is now ready for distillation. The still is now\r\n",
      "filled with wash, and a gentle heat applied, vaporising the alcohol,\r\n",
      "which passes through the still-head, and is cooled back to its liquid\r\n",
      "form in the worm, at the lower end of which it is received by pans,\r\n",
      "crocks, âpiggins,â or indeed any vessel which will hold it. From these\r\n",
      "receptacles it is put into jars or casksâmore commonly five-gallon\r\n",
      "âkegsââand conveyed to a place of safety. When all the wash has been\r\n",
      "distilled, the articles employed are carefully hidden, a favourite\r\n",
      "place for the still and worm being under water in the neighbouring\r\n",
      "stream. Then nothing remains but the distribution of the spirits in\r\n",
      "such a manner as to realise a handsome profit. This is an operation\r\n",
      "demanding all the craft of the distiller. To dispose of it to his\r\n",
      "immediate neighbours would be to disclose his secret, and they would\r\n",
      "either demand the poteen for nothing, or denounce him if he refused\r\n",
      "to give it. It must therefore be conveyed to a distance, and sold to\r\n",
      "some publican at such a price as will amply compensate both parties for\r\n",
      "their risk. As the publican must keep a record of all the spirits he\r\n",
      "receives, he incurs the danger of having material on his premises which\r\n",
      "is not entered in his stock-book; as a rule, therefore, the poteen is\r\n",
      "mixed with whisky resembling it in flavour, and the blend sold as the\r\n",
      "original.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In order to get the jar or cask safely into the town, the distiller\r\n",
      "usually envelops it in straw or hay, and tries to pass it off as\r\n",
      "innocent fodder; or another plan is to place it in the centre of a cart\r\n",
      "of turf, and on selling the turf to the proper person, its removal is\r\n",
      "easy, though occasionally even more ingenious methods are resorted to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunes acquired by means of illicit distillation have given rise\r\n",
      "to a very curious taunt amongst the inhabitants of the north-west\r\n",
      "of Ireland. When it was intended to convey to any person in the\r\n",
      "strongest possible manner that his pride in his family circumstances\r\n",
      "was only that of an upstart, the common expression for this was: âYour\r\n",
      "grandmother was Doherty ââ, and wore a tin pocket.â The origin of this\r\n",
      "saying was as follows. The northern part of the county of Donegal,\r\n",
      "particularly the district of Innishowen, is largely peopled by persons\r\n",
      "of the name of Doherty and OâDoherty. In past times, one of the best\r\n",
      "means of smuggling poteen into Londonderry and other towns in the\r\n",

      "son for her nieceâs husband? Itâs just like one of her ladyshipâs\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "told my love. But she has been brought up to think it a crime to marry\r\n",
      "a poor beggar without a fortune, and then sheâs so completely under the\r\n",

      "Dick, whose back was towards the party, gave a great start and nearly\r\n",

      "âLemonade! Ah-ha; monsieur sâamuse,â murmured Jules with a slight\r\n",

      "remarked the elder lady, who was none other than Lady Renshaw, in a low\r\n",
      "voice to her niece. âNo doubt he acquired the habit of drinking out of\r\n",
      "pewter while at college. I am told that they have many strange customs\r\n",
      "at the universities, which have been handed down from more barbarous\r\n",

      "âVery,â assented Miss Wynter, who had started at the first sound of\r\n",
      "Dickâs voice, and was now looking inquiringly at him. âThat voice!â she\r\n",
      "said to herself. âI could fancy that it was DickâI mean Mr Dulcimer,\r\n",
      "who was speaking. But that is impossible. And yetâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Dick had turned, and after gravely lifting his hat to the\r\n",
      "ladies, had resumed his seat, and was now intent again on his book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Renshaw was a fine, florid specimen of womanhood, who among her\r\n",
      "intimate friends gracefully acknowledged to being thirty-five years\r\n",
      "of age, but was probably at least ten years older. She still retained\r\n",
      "considerable traces of those good looks which several years previously\r\n",
      "had captured the elderly affections of the late Sir Timothy. Although\r\n",
      "her figure might display a greater amplitude of proportions than of\r\n",
      "yore, yet was her hair still black and glossy, her large dark eyes\r\n",
      "still as coldly bright as ever they had been, while if the fine bloom\r\n",
      "on her cheeks owed nothing of its tints to the lily, there are many\r\n",
      "people who prefer the rich damask of the rose even in the matter of\r\n",
      "complexion. Here, among the Westmoreland hills, her ladyship was\r\n",
      "dressed as richly and elaborately as if for a little shopping in Regent\r\n",
      "Street or a drive in the Park. Herein she showed her knowledge of the\r\n",
      "eternal fitness of things. Lady Renshaw in a cotton gown or a seaside\r\n",
      "wrapper would have looked little better than a dowdy. Simplicity and\r\n",
      "she had nothing in common. But Lady Renshaw fashionably attired in\r\n",
      "satins and laces was a sufficiently good imitation of a lady to pass\r\n",
      "current as such with nine people out of every dozen.\r\n",

      "graceful figure, black, sparkling eyes, and the sauciest little chin\r\n",
      "imaginable. Naturally, she was an unselfish, generous-hearted girl; but\r\n",
      "the circumstances of life and her auntâs hard worldly training were\r\n",
      "doing their best to spoil her. She, too, was dressed in the extreme of\r\n",
      "the prevalent fashion, and looked as if she might just have stepped out\r\n",
      "of the show-room of a Parisian _modiste_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Mr Dulcimer started, rose and bowed. âFor a day or two, madam, on my\r\n",

      "had addressed Jules the waiter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâm nearly certain itâs Dick,â said Bella to herself with her heart\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThen perhaps you can inform me at what hour the table-dâhÃ´te takes\r\n",

      "Dick knew quite well, but was not going to tell. âI only arrived a\r\n",
      "couple of hours ago, madam; but I will at once ascertain.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, no, no! Greatly obliged to you, but we are going indoors\r\n",
      "presently, and can then ascertain for ourselves.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lady Renshaw had turned, and was gazing through her eyeglass. âReally,\r\n",
      "my love, the view from this spot is too utterly exquisite,â she said.\r\n",
      "âSuch luminosity of atmosphereâsuch spontaneity of sunshine! Observe\r\n",
      "that magnificent effect of _chiaro-oscuro_ among the hills. Quite\r\n",
      "Ruskinesque. I dote on natureâespecially in her wilder moods.â\r\n",

      "off his darling beard and moustache, and come all this way on purpose\r\n",
      "to be near me!â she mused. âDoes any one else care enough for me to do\r\n",
      "as much as that? Heigh-ho! why is he so poor?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd now, dear, I think we had better go indoors,â said her ladyship\r\n",

      "and discretion seemed now to be my safest cue. When the bushranger\r\n",
      "had himself mounted, he caught my horseâs rein, and we started. For\r\n",
      "about a quarter of an hour we pursued the high-road at a quick walk, a\r\n",

      "bush, as I could easily judge from the fall of my horseâs feet on the\r\n",
      "soft sand-track. I should have mentioned that the night was a very dark\r\n",

      "insert my letters contradicting the many lying and libellous statements\r\n",
      "they have published regarding myself and my mates, you have vindicated\r\n",
      "the claims of the press to being a free and impartial organ of public\r\n",
      "expression. Now, no man who knows Frank Gardiner ever accused him of\r\n",
      "forgetting a friend or a service. I consider, Mr Fellgate, that you\r\n",
      "have done me a real service in this matter, and acted like a gentleman\r\n",
      "all round, and I would like to show you that I am not insensible of\r\n",
      "this. Though I am a bushranger, I am not a blackguard. If you will be\r\n",
      "good enough to accept this trifle, just in recognition of my admiration\r\n",
      "for you as an editor, and of my personal regard, you will do me a\r\n",
      "favour, Mr Fellgate.â As he spoke, Gardiner took from his breast-pocket\r\n",
      "a small morocco case and handed it to me. I opened the case, and found\r\n",
      "inside a handsome gold watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seldom, I venture to think, in the history of presentations was any\r\n",
      "one made under more singular circumstances. It seemed to reverse\r\n",
      "all precedent. Tradition was being read backwards; for instead of a\r\n",
      "highwayman taking a watch from me, I was getting one from him. To\r\n",
      "devise such a situation in fiction were, of course, easy enough; but I\r\n",
      "am relating a true incident, and as such I am inclined to think that\r\n",
      "the case was unique.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, I accepted the watch. What else could I do? Sticklers for\r\n",
      "morality may refuse to indorse my conduct in so doing; but these same\r\n",
      "stern moralists would have probably acted precisely as I did under the\r\n",
      "same circumstances. I was by no means so sure of my position that I\r\n",
      "could afford to affront or offend my strange friends in any way. Under\r\n",
      "that easy sang-froid, careless banter, and studied politeness which\r\n",
      "Gardiner had shown throughout our conversation, I knew that there\r\n",
      "remained a will that brooked no contradiction, and that had never yet\r\n",
      "been thwarted. Under circumstances like these, where personal danger\r\n",
      "enters as a large factor in determining our ultimate action, the\r\n",
      "majority of us are apt to give an easy and liberal interpretation to\r\n",
      "the minor ethics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took the watch, uttering some commonplace words of acceptance in\r\n",
      "doing so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd now, Mr Fellgate, I think our interview is at an end. I am glad\r\n",
      "you like the watch, and I think you will find that it is as good as\r\n",
      "it looks. In all probability, you and I will never meet again. But if\r\n",
      "ever you hear any of those snivelling city counter-jumpers maligning\r\n",
      "me and my brave fellows here, you at least may kindly think that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I was once more blindfolded, and Jim and I returned as we had come.\r\n",
      "When we reached the confines of the forest, however, we dismounted, and\r\n",

      "stealing through the bush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYouâll have to walk the rest of the way home, Mr Fellgate. Iâm like\r\n",
      "the ghost in the play, you understandâmust hook it with the first\r\n",
      "light. Sorry I canât take you to your door.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When I reached my rooms, I found my landlady already astir. She had not\r\n",

      "not a frequent occurrence, the _Beacon_ being only a bi-weekly issue.\r\n",
      "I lay down on the sofa in my sitting-room and took a couple of hoursâ\r\n",
      "sleep. When I awoke, the events of the night had for a little all the\r\n",
      "feeling of a dream; but that fancy quickly passed away. Over my morning\r\n",
      "coffee I examined my newly and so strangely acquired gift at greater\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Much has lately been written on the subject of Western Ranchingâenough\r\n",
      "to make the matter perhaps wearisome to some readers; but I have not\r\n",
      "seen any writer touch on the worst side. Frequently I hear of young\r\n",
      "fellows, who, attracted by the tales they have read, are eager to go\r\n",
      "West and into ranching. For those who conduct it properly, there is\r\n",
      "money in this business; but let me tell these youngsters that there is\r\n",
      "little else in it. At first, everything is novel; but that soon wears\r\n",
      "off, and then for a thoroughly good monotonous life. I know nothing\r\n",
      "to compare with it. Life in a log cabin, with bacon and beans and\r\n",
      "canned vegetables for food, and a lot of uneducated cowboys as daily\r\n",
      "associates, is not the most fascinating thing in this world. Your\r\n",
      "men may be good, honest, trustworthy fellows; but they are rough and\r\n",
      "uncouth in speech and manners, and you soon get utterly tired of their\r\n",
      "company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Your letters, papers, and magazines help, of course, to while away\r\n",
      "many a weary hour. Riding after cattle, branding, &c., is your chief\r\n",
      "excitement; but let me say that constant daily work at that gets\r\n",
      "monotonous in time. You have some big-game shooting, always more or\r\n",
      "less difficult of access; and you have trout-fishingâsuccessful, when\r\n",
      "the fish choose to bite. I have generally found the best fishing when\r\n",
      "the weather was hottest and the mosquitoes thickest. Again, remember\r\n",
      "that a small band of cattle does not return ready cash in proportion to\r\n",

      "To a lover of scenery, the change from Britainâs green hills and mossy\r\n",

      "alas! how quickly do the yellows and browns triumph! I do not write\r\n",

      "The best ranges are in the north-western country, and the winters are\r\n",
      "simply awful. It has always been a wonder to me how cattle survive\r\n",
      "at all, much less come out in good condition in spring. How about\r\n",
      "the nice gentlemanly fellow from home and home luxuries, enduring a\r\n",
      "winter with thermometer ranging from twenty to sixty degrees _below_\r\n",
      "zero! (Two years ago, the spirit glasses stood in Southern Montana at\r\n",
      "sixty degrees below zero for over twenty hours at one time. Needless\r\n",
      "to say the mercury glasses were all frozen _solid_.) He rides forth on\r\n",
      "the range to look at his cattle, and comes in, probably, with nose,\r\n",
      "cheekbones, hands, and feet nipped, more or less severely. Next day, he\r\n",
      "does the same, with similar results, and then vows he wonât go again.\r\n",
      "He remains indoors for a few days, roasting beside a big stove, gets\r\n",
      "impatient at the deadly weariness of his life, and goes fishing through\r\n",
      "the iceâcatches a few fish; results same as when riding. He then thinks\r\n",
      "he will try deer-tracking, or possibly a little amateur trapping. In\r\n",
      "either case he tramps all day through deep snow, varied by falling into\r\n",
      "a hidden spring-hole now and again, getting wet, and instantly his legs\r\n",
      "are incased in a solid mail of ice, which he must break, in order to\r\n",
      "walk. He comes home at night tired out, perhaps with game, more likely\r\n",
      "without; and vowing he has had enough of that sort of thing, falls back\r\n",
      "on cards and whisky, and so gets through the winter.\r\n",

      "church has been brought to light. In excavating for the foundations\r\n",
      "of the piers of the new central tower, some ancient masonry was found\r\n",
      "deep below the surface, which was at once pronounced to be the remains\r\n",
      "of the original Saxon church, which, together with the monastery, had\r\n",
      "been destroyed by the marauding Danes. These remains indicated that\r\n",
      "the former church occupied nearly the position of the present one; and\r\n",

      "floor of the church above. The vault was found to be filled with all\r\n",
      "sorts of apparent rubbish in stone and metal. On close inspection,\r\n",
      "however, much of this proved to be parts of the choir-screen, which,\r\n",
      "from its great beauty, had been the glory of the church and the\r\n",
      "admiration of historians for centuries, but which, at the sacking of\r\n",
      "the church by Cromwellâs soldiers in 1643, had been pulled to the\r\n",
      "ground with ropes, and then smashed to pieces. The rest of the contents\r\n",

      "on exposure to the air; fragments of broken swords and pikes; pieces of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There are very few homes whose inmates have not at some time or other\r\n",
      "suffered more or less severely from the effects of a burn; there are\r\n",
      "few persons who ever forget the severity of the pain that succeeds a\r\n",
      "bad burn; and yet there are very few who make any provision for the\r\n",
      "proper treatment of such wounds. This neglect arises from indifference\r\n",
      "or from ignorance, but chiefly the latter. A burn treated in time does\r\n",
      "not take nearly so long to heal, and generally heals better than it\r\n",
      "otherwise would. The object of the present paper is to make familiar a\r\n",
      "few of the remedies which are generally applied to burnsâremedies so\r\n",
      "simple in themselves that they can be applied by any person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best thing to apply to a burned or scalded part is Carron oil\r\n",
      "spread on lint or linen. The main object in the treatment of a burn is\r\n",
      "to keep the affected part out of contact with the air; but the part of\r\n",
      "the treatment to which our attention should be first directed is that\r\n",
      "which will lessen or remove the pain. Ice or cold water is sometimes\r\n",
      "used; and sometimes water moderately warm, or a gentle heat, gives\r\n",
      "relief. Carron oilâso called from the famous Carron ironworks, where it\r\n",
      "is extensively usedânot only lessens the immediate pain, but covers the\r\n",
      "part with a film which effectually shuts out the air and prevents the\r\n",
      "skin getting dry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This Carron oil can be prepared in a very simple way. It consists\r\n",
      "of equal parts of olive oil and lime-water. Olive oil, or salad or\r\n",
      "Lucca oil, is the oil best suited for the purpose; but if not easily\r\n",
      "obtainable, linseed oil answers the purpose very well. Lime-water can\r\n",
      "be easily made by any one, if it cannot be procured otherwise. About\r\n",
      "a teaspoonful of the lime used by buildersâif the purer kind is not\r\n",
      "obtainableâadded to a pint of water and well shaken, is all that is\r\n",
      "required. It is then allowed to settle, and the water when required\r\n",
      "is drawn off without disturbing the sediment at the bottom. Pour the\r\n",
      "oil on the lime-water, stir or shake well, and the mixture is ready\r\n",
      "for use. It is poured freely between two folds of lint, or the lint\r\n",
      "dipped in the mixture; the lint applied to the wound, and held in\r\n",
      "position by a bandage. The wound may be dressed twice a day; but in\r\n",
      "dressing, the wound should be exposed to the air the shortest possible\r\n",
      "time. If the lint adheres to the wound, it must not be pulled off, but\r\n",
      "first moistened thoroughly with the oil, when it comes off easily.\r\n",
      "In some cases, it is not advisable to remove the lint. Under such\r\n",
      "circumstances, the best way to proceed is to lift up one fold of the\r\n",
      "lint, drop the oil within the folds, replace the fold as before, and\r\n",
      "secure the bandage. Carron oil is one of those things that no household\r\n",
      "should be at any time without.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Considering the simplicity of the cure, how easily olive oil and\r\n",
      "lime-water can be obtained, let us hope that for the sake of relieving\r\n",

      "represents the god not as the coarse dissipated old man, but according\r\n",
      "to his later aspect, as a beautiful effeminate youth. It is singularly\r\n",
      "well preserved, the right hand only being missing. Its great beauty was\r\n",
      "at once recognised, and casts were immediately made, one of which is at\r\n",
      "Berlin, another at Strassburg, and a third in the new Cast Museum of\r\n",
      "Sculpture at Cambridge. The statue represents a youth standing with the\r\n",
      "weight of the body thrown on the right leg; the right hand is raised,\r\n",
      "and held, it is supposed, the two-handled wine-cup or _kantharos_ of\r\n",
      "Bacchus. Over the right shoulder is thrown a _nebris_ (fawn-skin),\r\n",
      "which falls back and front with studied symmetry. A question has arisen\r\n",
      "amongst the learned on these subjects as to whether this beautiful\r\n",
      "work of ancient art is itself an original, or a copy in marble from a\r\n",
      "bronze original. And then comes the still more important inquiry, what\r\n",
